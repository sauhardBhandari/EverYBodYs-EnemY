"Everybody Needs Someone"

Calm it cause you love her
When you gonna strike again
Leave it undercover
Just dying to be friends

Everybody needs someone
Everybody needs someone
Oh oh
Everybody needs someone

Use love like a weapon
To self destruct your soul
Locked up in your prison
Captured by yourself

Everybody needs someone
Everybody needs someone
Oh oh
Everybody needs someone

When you let it in your head
Then you let it in your heart
Are you live your life in pain?
And the day you let it win
It will tell you [?]
Everybody feels the way

Everybody needs
Everybody needs someone
Everybody needs someone
Oh oh
Everybody needs someone

Everybody needs someone
Everybody needs someone
Oh oh
Everybody needs someone
